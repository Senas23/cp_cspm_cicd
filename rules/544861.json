If you don't specify a security group when you launch an instance, the instance is automatically assigned to this default security group. Security groups provide stateful filtering of ingress/egress network traffic to AWS resources. It is recommended that the default security group restrict all traffic.\nThe default VPC in every region should have its default security group updated to comply. Any newly created VPCs will automatically contain a default security group that will need remediation to comply with this recommendation.\n\nNOTE: When implementing this recommendation, VPC flow logging is invaluable in determining the least privilege port access required by systems to work properly because it can log all packet acceptances and rejections occurring under the current security groups. This dramatically reduces the primary barrier to least privilege engineering - discovering the minimum ports required by systems in the environment. Even if the VPC flow logging recommendation in this benchmark is not adopted as a permanent security measure, it should be used during any period of discovery and engineering for least privileged security groups.",

By default, new buckets, access points, and objects don�t allow public access. However, users can modify bucket policies, access point policies, or object permissions to allow public access.  To remediate an existing Bucket Policy to non-public access, follow these steps:\n\n1.\tSign in to your S3 bucket console - https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/\n2.\tClick on the bucket you want to remediate the bucket policy\n3.\tOn the Bucket dashboard, click on Permissions tab\n4.\tIn the Permissions tab, click on the Bucket Policy button\n5.\tEnsure  that the Principal and Resource elements along with Action(such as �s3:*�), in the policy do not have an �*�(values that contain a wildcard). If the bucket policy contains access to all Resource elements and Principal elements, you can make these policies non-public by including any of the condition keys, such as ; aws:SourceArn\naws:SourceVpc\naws:SourceVpce\naws:SourceOwner\naws:SourceAccount\ns3:x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id\naws:userid, outside the pattern 'AROLEID:*'\ns3:DataAccessPointArn, using a fixed value.\nPlease refer to - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/add-bucket-policy.html to create a new Bucket Policy.\nSimilarly, make sure that the S3 bucket access control lists (ACLs) that provide read, write, or full-access to �Everyone� or �Any authenticated AWS user� does not exist. For more information, please refer - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html\n\n",
